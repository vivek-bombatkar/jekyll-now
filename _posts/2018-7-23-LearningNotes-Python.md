    glob_var = 10

## if __name__ == "__main__":
> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do
- The global variable, __name__, in the module that is the entry point to your program, is '__main__'. Otherwise, it's the name you import the module by.

- So, code under the if block will only run if the module is the entry point to your program.

- It allows the code in the module to be importable by other modules, without executing the code block beneath on import.

## yield
> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do
- yield is a keyword that is used like return, except the function will return a generator.
```python
def getGenerator():
    list = range(5)
    for i in list:
        yield i*i
myGen = getGenerator()
for i in myGen:
    print(i)
```
- Generators are iterators, a kind of iterable you can only iterate over once. Generators do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly:

## *args and **kwargs
> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36901/what-does-double-star-asterisk-and-star-asterisk-do-for-parameters

- The *args and **kwargs is a common idiom to allow arbitrary number of arguments to functions 
- The *args will give you all function parameters as a tuple
- The **kwargs will give you all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter as a dictionary

```python
def test(*args):
    for a in args:
        print(a)
test(1)
test(1,2,3,4,5)

def test_new(**kwargs):
    for a in kwargs:
        print(a,kwargs[a])
test_new(name="vb",age=27,sal=2000)

1
1
2
3
4
5
name vb
age 27
sal 2000
```

##  Python Scope LEGB Rule.
> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/291978/short-description-of-the-scoping-rules

- L, Local — Names assigned in any way within a function (def or lambda)), and not declared global in that function.
- E, Enclosing-function locals — Name in the local scope of any and all statically enclosing functions (def or lambda), from inner to outer.
- G, Global (module) — Names assigned at the top-level of a module file, or by executing a global statement in a def within the file.
- B, Built-in (Python) — Names preassigned in the built-in names module : open,range,SyntaxError,...

## The pipfile i.e. virtual environment
> https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-manage-your-python-projects-with-pipenv

```commandline
pipenv install <abc>
pipenv install <xyz>
#OR
pipenv install requirments.txt
#this will create 'pipfile'
```

Once we have pipfile created run below to... 
 - automagically locate the Pipfiles
 - create a new virtual environment 
 - and install the necessary packag
```commandline
pipenv install
```


To activate virtual environment
```commandline
pipenv shell
```

Running code in the virtual environment
```commandline
pipenv run python <myCode>.py
```


And Finaly
```commandline
exit
```

> https://docs.pipenv.org/basics/
```markdown
- Generally, keep both Pipfile and Pipfile.lock in version control.
- Do not keep Pipfile.lock in version control if multiple versions of Python are being targeted.
- Specify your target Python version in your Pipfile’s [requires] section. Ideally, you should only have one target Python version, as this is a deployment tool.
- pipenv install is fully compatible with pip install syntax, for which the full documentation can be found here.
