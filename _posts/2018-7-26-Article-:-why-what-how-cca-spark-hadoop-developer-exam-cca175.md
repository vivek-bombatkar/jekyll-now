> I recently passed Cloudera Certified Spark and Hadoop Developer Exam (with 8 out of 10 questions).
> I would like to share my experience for those who would like to go for it (so that they won’t make mistakes I made in exam!).

Exam Link : [http://www.cloudera.com/training/certification/cca-spark.html](http://www.cloudera.com/training/certification/cca-spark.html)

Why I gave this,

·        Though I am working on Cloudera distribution of Hadoop from couples of years, I was not necessarily touching all of the Hadoop ecosystems. This exam gave me reason to study and practice most of the Hadoop ecosystems components.

·        Also exposure towards the Spark framework is the most stand out part of this certification.

What resources you will be provided in exam,

·        You will have Ubuntu system with Cloudera Hadoop ecosystem installed on it, links to Cloudera documentation and user manual mention on their certification page ([http://www.cloudera.com/training/certification/cca-spark.html](http://www.cloudera.com/training/certification/cca-spark.html)) and a text editor; Sublime Text. I did not use any other resource than this.

·        Details like HDFS file location, DB and table names for Hive and MySql will be provided along with each question.

·        **To connect to MySql I was not provided with connection string, so I need to get host name by running command.

How I prepared,

·        It’s a hands-on exam, i.e. you need to write a code to get desire result and hence practice is the only way to prepare. You can overlook the theory (spark DAG, memory management, etc.) if only focusing on the exam right now.

·        Sqoop Import Export, Hive DDL, Spark transformations & actions and Avro tool are the only topics need to study.

·        If you practice well before exam then you will find most of the questions are based on very basic knowledge.

·        For questions on Spark, code file (for Scala and Python both) will be provided. You only have to fill-in-the-blanks with appropriate spark transformations/actions and run it through the shell script (which will again be provided).

Things to remember,

·        Each question will be having details of where you should store result set and how exactly it should look like. I believe for evaluation they are looking at the result set only.

·        Time management is important! Keep that in mind from first questions. You will get 2 hours for 10 questions, i.e. 10 minutes for each question approximately. I will suggest spend first 5 minutes to overview all 10 questions. Go for easy one first such as avro tool , Hive or Sqoop. This will give you enough time to focus on Spark questions. I spend most of the time on spark scenarios only.

·        Internet speed also matters. Make sure you have at least 4 mbps or more speed with uninterrupted internet connection. I will suggest have some backup ready in case of power or internet failure. The cluster provided by them is not that fast and most of the problem requires you to work on huge data (after all it’s a Big Data certification).

·        Examiner will be talking to you over live chat and monitoring your screen and you (through web cam). He asked me show the entire room by moving web cam around the system. I also need to clear my desk and not even allowed to use blank paper and pen for rough work!

·        Make sure you familiar with Ubuntu system and Sublime Text before exam. Get to know some basic tricks like, copy & past (Ctrl+c/v for Sublime Text and Ctrl+Shift+c/v for Ubuntu). Also get to know how to increase the terminal font size.

·        Also get yourself familiar with Cloudera documentation, mention on their certification page. However I did not get enough time to search through documentation.

·        I received the performance report including pass or fail result within few hours of exam by email. Digital copy of certification and license number will take 3-4 days to come.

Good Luck !
